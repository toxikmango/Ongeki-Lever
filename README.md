# Ongeki-Lever
A 3D printable ongeki lever using 5/16" and M3 fasteners

Print at your own risk (my printer tolerance will be different than yours). I'm not responsible for wasted filament. Use the test prints to adjust scaling (+/-%) to get things to fit.

Designed to use this encoder 
20mm Contactless Digitized Potentiometer 6mm shaft 0-5v

Printed with 3 perimeters, top, and bottom layers with 15% infill. 

--Uses 5/16" hardware
--5/16" fully threaded bolt for the handle (5.5-6" long)
--5/16" fully threaded for the pivot rod (about 3.75"-4" long)
--5/16" nylock nuts (4)
--608 skateboard bearings (2 of them) (8mm ID, 22mm OD, 7mm thick)
--m3 bolts and nuts to attach the top and bottom clamp together. (35mm long)
--m3 bolts can be used to attach the assembly to the controller body or #6 screws countersunk from the top of the controller going down into the lever assembly mounting holes. (Length depends on your wood thickness but I used 3/4" long screws.) 
--Dielectric grease

You put dielectric grease or something similar between the "tension chuck" and the "top/bottom clamp's" mating surfaces.
You will also want to sand the "tension chuck" and possibly the mating faces of the clamps to provide an even better experience. 
You can also add some sort of lubricant on the gear teeth. I used GPL 105 lubricant (oil based lubricant) as I have it on  hand from lubing keyboard switches. But something light would be better than a thick grease based lubricant. 

If parts don't press fit in suuuuper snug, you could use some glue. Assembly should need no adhesives. Maybe a few drops of CA glue holding the top clamp to the body, but that's really it.
